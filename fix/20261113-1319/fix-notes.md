# Fix notes — run 20261113-1319

## Decisions
- Follow the supplied safety gate: no merge, production deployment, release endpoint, or live Worker write before an explicit owner approval at the release gate.
- Do not request secret values in chat. Use connected integrations or mark the dependent check BLOCKED when a credential is unavailable. Cloudflare deploy write permission and the Worker admin token are not verified.
- The audit prompt's suggested browser session could not be created: KERNEL returned HTTP 403 because the organization plan requires a payment method. Do not add paid access; use repository-local Playwright and read-only HTTP where possible. Production interactive browser verification remains BLOCKED.
- The required managed-environment status tool and startup network-policy file are unavailable. Record this limitation; do not assume the network policy is applied. The observed proxy can reach the public Pages and Worker GET endpoints.
- Keep this run isolated from the dirty audit worktree. Current local audit docs are preserved; all code work belongs on `fix/audit-20261113-1319`, and all reports belong on `fixlog/20261113-1319`.
- Drive search found no existing `Math Scratchpad Fix *` folder; branch searches found no existing `fixlog/*` or `fix/audit-*` run to resume. Create RUN_ID 20261113-1319 once.

## Phase 0 — bootstrap and verified drift

| Tool / source | Availability | Evidence / fallback |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | Available, admin + push | Repository permissions read; main `7eeeef0`; #91 `59913b8`, #92 `f384ca4`, #93 `d1c730c`; all three open, matching the audit record. Use connector for refs/PRs if direct git authentication fails. |
| Google Drive | Available, personal Drive | Search and root folder creation succeeded; only this run's new folder will be written. |
| Cloudflare | Read available; write unknown | Account, Worker script and deployment reads succeeded. Latest production version is `d376eafb-f0ab-42b9-8409-aab8f9bbaead`, 100%. Do not probe write with a mutation before release approval. |
| Browser | KERNEL read context available; browser creation BLOCKED | Session creation returned 403: billing payment method required. Fallback: local Playwright, `curl` GET/HEAD, and report prod interactive checks BLOCKED. |
| Code execution / network | Available with limits | Node 24.22.1, npm 11.9.0, Git 2.52.0; `node_modules` present in the audit checkout. The runtime-status tool is absent and `/etc/codex/network-policy.json` is absent. Proxied public Pages/Worker GET requests returned 200. |
| Notion | Optional connector available | Not queried; shared Sessions and all Pomodoro data are protected. |
| Gitleaks | Available | `/tmp/ms-gitleaks/gitleaks` 8.30.1. Run on new/changed artifacts before each checkpoint upload or GitHub commit. |

- `GET /health` returned HTTP 200 with `{"ok":true,"service":"math-scratchpad-sync"}`; current endpoint omits required `env` and `sha` fields (AUD-004).
- Pages HEAD returned HTTP 200; `GET /version.json` returned 404 (AUD-004).
- Current production Worker deployment matches the recorded version and time; no production mutation was attempted.
- Worker admin status was not read because the required admin token is unavailable; use the prompt's fallback and keep phone-recovery server status NOT_TESTED.
- Main SHA was independently verified through GitHub API and matches local `origin/main`; no drift from the audit baseline.
